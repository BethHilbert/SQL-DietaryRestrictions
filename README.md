# Dietary Restrictions Around The Globe (using SQL, R, Tableau)

Data modeling using SQL Server, R, and Tableau. Created December 2018. 

Goal
--------------------
This was a small project to demonstrate normalizing a database within SQL Server and then connecting to that database using R and Tableau.  I used a study by Nielsen which showed that consumers are making the decision of what they are going to eat
based on what is not in their foods (fat, sugar, sodium).

Data
--------------------
The Nielsen “Health and Ingredient Sentiment Survey” records self-reported dietary restrictions. The
data was collected from 30,000 online respondents in 63 countries. The data was published by Nielsen
in August 2016 and is available as an Excel spreadsheet from Makeover Monday Website titled
“Restricted Dietary Requirements Around the Globe.” http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/datasets-2017/
